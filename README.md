Fuzzy Logic Student Performance Evaluation
This project implements a fuzzy logic system to objectively evaluate a student's overall performance. Using the Mamdani Fuzzy Inference Technique, 
the system processes three key inputs—attendance, internal marks, and external marks—to calculate a performance score. 
The system is built with Python and uses skfuzzy and NumPy to define linguistic labels (e.g., "Poor," "Excellent") and a set of rules, 
providing a practical demonstration of fuzzy logic in educational assessment.
